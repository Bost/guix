Remove the CMake machinery for the Metis/Parmetis compatibility layer:
it has zero users and complicates things due to the separate "metis"
output.

Notably, the assumption in 'SCOTCHConfig.cmake' is that *metisTargets.cmake
are in the same directory, which is not the case here.  Furthermore,
'*metisTargets-relwithdebuginfo.cmake' assumes 'libscotchmetis*.so*' is
available under '_IMPORT_PREFIX', which is only the case when
'libscotchmetis*.so' is installed in the same directory as 'libscotch.so'.
